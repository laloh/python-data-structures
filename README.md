# Linear Structures

# Stacks

A Stack is structured, ordered collection of items where items are added to and
removed from the end called the "top". Stacks are ordered LIFO.

# Queues

A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens
at one end, called the "rear", and the removal of existing items occurs at other 
end, commonly called the "front". As an element enters the queue it starts at 
the rear and makes its way toward the front, waiting until that time when it is the
next element to be removed.

# Deques

A deque, also known as a double-ended queue, is an ordered collection of items similar
to the queue. It has two ends, a front end and a rear, and the items remain positioned
in the collection. This hybrid linear structure provides all the capabilities of stacks
and queues in a single data structure.

# List

A list is a collection of items where each item holds a relative position with respect
to the others. 

# Recursion

Recursion is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down
into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a small enough problem that
it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion involves a function calling itself.
While it may otherwise be very difficult to program.

All recursive algorithms must obey three importan laws:

    1. A recursive algorithm must have a base case.
        Is typically a problem that is small enough to solve directly
    2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case
        Means that some data that the algorithm is using is modified, Usually the data that
        represents our problem gets smaller in some way.
    3. A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.
